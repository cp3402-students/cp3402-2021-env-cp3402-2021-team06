<p>There are many different ways to use the web besides a mouse and a pair of eyes.  Users navigate for example with a keyboard only or with their voice. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the functionality, including menus, links and forms should work using a <strong>keyboard only</strong>. This is essential for all assistive technology to work properly. The only way to test this, at the moment, is manually. The best time to test this is during development.</p>

<h3>How to keyboard test:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tab through your pages, links and forms to do the following tests:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Confirm that all links can be reached and activated via keyboard, including any in dropdown submenus.</li><li>Confirm that all links get a visible focus indicator (e.g., a border highlight).</li><li>Confirm that all <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/best-practices/markup/the-css-class-screen-reader-text/\">visually hidden links</a> (e.g. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/best-practices/markup/skip-links/\">skip links</a>) become visible when in focus.</li><li>Confirm that all form input fields and buttons can be accessed and used via keyboard.</li><li>Confirm that all interactions, buttons, and other controls can be triggered via keyboard — any action you can complete with a mouse must also be performable via keyboard.</li><li>Confirm that focus doesn’t move in unexpected ways around the page.</li><li>Confirm that using shift+tab to move backwards works as well.</li></ul>

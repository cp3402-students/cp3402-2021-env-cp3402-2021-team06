If the Theme includes a custom option to prevent static Pages from displaying comments, such option must be disabled (i.e. so that static Pages display comments) by default.
Also, verify that this Page does not display taxonomy information (e.g. categories or tags) or time-stamp information (Page publish date/time)."
